# camera_permissions
## Grizzhacks 5 project
Allow users to allow/deny access to the Camera, everytime it makes a request. 
Only works on Chrome, will push to Safari/Brave in the future.
Does not work on Safari because of Apple's Sandbox mode, and does not work on Brave because of the active permission blocking pre-installed on those browsers.
